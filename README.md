# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Step 1: Setup Your React App
1. Create a new React app:
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app react-chat-app
   cd react-chat-app
   ```
2. Install the necessary packages: 
    ```sh
    npm install firebase react-firebase-hooks styled-components
    ```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

    export { myAuth, myFireStore };
    ```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Step 4: Styling Your Components
In this step, you are free to choose any styling library or methodology that you are comfortable with. Some popular choices include styled-components, emotion, tailwindcss, or even plain CSS. The important part is to ensure that your components are styled in a way that enhances the user experience.

1. Choose a styling library or methodology and install any necessary packages.
2. Apply styles to your components. Make sure to consider responsiveness and usability.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
